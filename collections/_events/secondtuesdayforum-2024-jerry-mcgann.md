Please join us for the rescheduled launch of a new digital humanities series, the Second Tuesday Forum, brought to you by the Scholars' Lab and IATH in the Library’s DH Center. Professor Jerome McGann will be discussing his recent work, editing Jaime de Angulo’s Old Time Stories: Voice, Text, Image. Participants are asked to read a short article in advance, “Editing and Curating Online: Beginning Again” from Textual Cultures. The presentation will begin at 2:00, followed by Q&A and conversation.

Jerome McGann is an award-winning critic and pioneer of digital humanities, Emeritus Professor of English at the University of Virginia, author of some two dozen books, director of the influential Rossetti Archive (on the works of poet and painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti) since the founding of IATH, and the peer-review research platform, NINES (ca. 2002-2008), and altogether a leader in textual studies.

This event is free and open to the public. All all welcome. 

This is an in-person event; you can add the event to your calendar by visiting <a href="https://cal.lib.virginia.edu/calendar/events/McGann">the Library event calendar page</a>.
