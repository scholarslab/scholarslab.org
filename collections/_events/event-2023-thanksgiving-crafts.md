Make a Thanksgiving themed electronic craft!

Make a card in the TinkerTank, or grab a bag to take home and make. The bag includes components to make a light up card or decoration.

Or use our button makers, sewing machines, CNC paper cutter, and electronics to make Thanksgiving decorations and decor.

Register to make sure a kit is available for you. You can pick up the kit anytime Clemons Library is open from November 14-18th in the TinkerTank in Clemons 3rd floor.

The Scholars' Lab TinkerTank is located in Clemons Library on the 3rd floor. See here for TinkerTank open hours: <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/hours">https://www.library.virginia.edu/hours</a>
