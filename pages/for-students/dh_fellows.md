If you're interested in learning more about the fellowship or have questions about anything you read below, please consider attending the information session for the 2024-2025 cohort - **Monday, January 15th, 2024 from 11:00-12:00 on Zoom.** Please [register](https://cal.lib.virginia.edu/event/11409187) to attend.

The Digital Humanities Fellowship supports advanced doctoral students doing innovative work in the digital humanities at the University of Virginia. The Scholars’ Lab offers Grad Fellows advice and assistance with the creation and analysis of digital content, as well as consultation on intellectual property issues and best practices in digital scholarship and DH software development. The highly competitive Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance the humanities and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.

Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per fellowship year. As such, students are expected to be in residence on Grounds for the duration of the fellowship.

We have received some questions about how the Scholars’ Lab Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities will be affected by new departmental support packages. Going forward, including for the coming academic year, the Scholars’ Lab fellowship will provide $24,480 in living support during the academic year, and the package will include health insurance, fees, and tuition remission. No teaching is required as a part of the fellowship. Students will apply to this fellowship in their fifth year of the PhD for a sixth year of funding in conjunction with the Scholars’ Lab.

**History**

Since its beginnings in 2007, the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities has supported a number of students. Past fellowship winners can be found on our [People](/people) page. In the past, the program itself has been supported by a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The fellowship is currently sustained by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, and the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund.

**Eligibility, Conditions, and Requirements**

* Applicants must be ABD, having completed all course requirements and been admitted to candidacy for the doctorate in the humanities, social sciences or the arts at the University of Virginia. 
* Going forward, including for the coming academic year, the Scholars’ Lab fellowship will provide $24,480 in living support during the academic year, and the package will include health insurance, fees, and tuition remission. No teaching is required as a part of the fellowship. Students will apply to this fellowship in their fifth year of the PhD for a sixth year of funding in conjunction with the Scholars’ Lab. 
* The funding packages for Architecture School students operate on a different funding cycle. As such, Architecture PhD students should confirm their eligibility with the Lab and their program director prior to applying.
* Applicants are expected to have digital humanities experience, though this background could take a variety of forms. Experience can include formal fellowships like the [Praxis Program](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/), but it could also include work on a collaborative digital project, comfort with programing and code management, public scholarship, or critical engagement with digital tools.
* Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.
* A faculty advisor must review and approve the scholarly content of the proposal.
* The student's Director of Graduate Studies must approve the student's application.
* We welcome and encourage applicants to discuss how your particular backgrounds and identities, whatever that might mean for you, factor into your unique ability to contribute to the program. 

**How to Apply**

A complete application package will include the following materials:

* a cover letter (roughly 2 pages single-spaced), addressed to the selection committee, containing:
  * a summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in his or her dissertation research;
  * a summary of the applicant’s experience with digital projects;
  * a description of Scholars' Lab staff whose expertise will be relevant and useful to the proposed project;
  * a description of how the fellowship would be transformative for your work and your career;
  * and, most importantly, a description of what you propose to do with us over the course of the fellowship year. Typically this takes the form of a digital project with an associated research plan or proposed course of study.
* a dissertation abstract (no more than one page);
* a short review of relevant digital projects and scholarship with which your proposed work for the year will be in dialogue (no more than two pages);
* a brief note (a PDF or screenshot of an email is fine) from the applicant’s dissertation director attesting to the fact that applicant has discussed the project with them and they support the application;
* a brief note (a PDF or screenshot of an email is fine) from the applicant's department chair stating that they are aware the student is applying for the fellowship and support the application (given that holding the fellowship can affect teaching rosters);
* and your availability for a 30-minute interview slot during the following times: **Monday, February 26 from 2:00-3:30 or Wednesday, February 28th from 10:00-11:30**. This should be communicated in the cover letter. These time slots will be used for finalist interviews. We’re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those interview times in advance, though we can work out alternatives if scheduling difficulties arise. If you are unavailable then, please suggest other times on or around those days.

Completed application materials can be uploaded through the [GSAS application portal](https://virginia.academicworks.com/). Please do consider this application to be part of a process - the beginning of a conversation about how we can work together.

During the 2024-2025 cycle, Brandon will be on leave starting January 15th, 2024. Applicants with questions about Grad Fellowships, the application process, or their eligibility are encouraged to write soon for clarification. After January 15th, correspondence regarding DH project proposals can be directed to [Ronda Grizzle](mailto:rag9b@virginia.edu).
