Whether you are crowd sourcing spatial data or performing survey work, having an application that records location and uploads data directly to a mapping application is incredibly useful.   

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS.  Sessions will be hands-on demonstrations with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance.  All sessions will be taught on **Wednesdays from 11AM to 12PM** and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community. Late-comers are welcome and encouraged, registration remains open until the end of class.
