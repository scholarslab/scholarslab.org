Please join us (and especially invite any potentially interested students!) to an Intro to DH workshop by Miriam Posner. Dr. Posner will be speaking to Alison Boothâ€™s Introduction to DH class, but the event is open to all to join, and we will have sandwiches! Anyone is welcome, especially those who are tech or DH-curious, and perhaps not yet experienced with working with data.

To get a sense of Dr. Posner's teaching, check out her vast tutorials list: <a href="https://miriamposner.com/blog/tutorials-ive-written/">https://miriamposner.com/blog/tutorials-ive-written/</a>

This is an in-person event. More information and a calendar invite can be found at <a href="https://cal.lib.virginia.edu/calendar/events/MiriamPosnerWorkshop">https://cal.lib.virginia.edu/calendar/events/MiriamPosnerWorkshop</a>.
