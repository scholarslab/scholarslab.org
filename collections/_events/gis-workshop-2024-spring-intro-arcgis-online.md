ArcGIS Online is the cloud-based younger sibling of ArcGIS Pro. It can't do as some of the less flashy, GISy kind of things, but it's in the cloud, it's connected, which adds all the hip functionality we've come to expect. With ArcGIS Online, you can find and create spatial data, maps, and applications. You can take advantage of a limited but powerful set of analysis tools that take advantage of cloud computing and pre-configured data and resources. And, you can share and collaborate with small groups or with the world. It's an easy-to-use entry into the world of GIS, all from the comfort of your browser.

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS. Sessions will be hands-on demonstrations with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance. All sessions will be taught on **Wednesdays from 11AM to 12PM** and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community. Late-comers are welcome and encouraged, registration remains open until the end of class.
